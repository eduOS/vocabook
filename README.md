This is a Vim plugin for building vocabulary. I decided to create it after being inspired by a MOOC on Edx titled Principle of Written English delievered by Maggie Sokolik and all the team at College Writing 2.2x from Berkeley.

It's now a vocabulary book the mission of which is to facilitate EFL writing during the whole writing process from prewriting to making a final copy. 

The plugin is triggered when a shortcut is pressed, resulting in automatically looking up all information about the word under the cursor from natural language tool kit (NLTK) and from MySQL database and openning a new window showing all information aforementioned and the sentence containing the word under the cursor. The window is editable where you can tag the word for convenience of extracting later and can also practice making sentences using the word. Tags and sentences and others are then stored back into the database.
